# Hadoop-101
Introductory material for learning Haddop

Using this guide, you'll apply your fundamental understanding of Hadoop through some lab-driven work. Before each set of lab steps, we'll discuss some fundamental points to get you started. 

To keep things simple, we'll access a Hadoop cluster using HUE, a portal service that offers graphic user interfaces for:
* HDFS user operations
* Submitting and browsing a MapReduce job
* Browisng file data in a relational model
* Running queries using Hive
* Running jobs using Pig

HUE offers a lot more than this, but for a half-day session with many attendees, we'll keep it simple and leave plenty of time for questions. This sessions will run from 1- 4:30 PM. Since we have many people in attendance, we'll combine lab and break time. In class, we'll set specific times to begin new material.

By the end of this session, you'll have had time to review your Hadoop knowledge, ask questions about the way it works, and work on a small Hadoop cluster that is running in AWS.
