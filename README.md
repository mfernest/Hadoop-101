# Hadoop-101
Introductory material for learning Hadoop

Using this guide, you'll apply your fundamental understanding of Hadoop through some lab-driven work. 

Before each set of lab steps, we'll discuss some fundamentals to get you started. 

To keep things simple, your labs access a Hadoop cluster using HUE, a portal service that supplies browser-based interfaces for:
* HDFS file operations
* Submitting and browsing jobs
* Browsing file data via a relational model
* Running queries using Hive
* Running jobs using Pig

HUE offers even more, but for a half-day session with dozens of attendees, we'll keep it simple and leave plenty of time for questions. This session runs for 3.5 hours. With so many people in attendance, we'll combine lab and break times. LOnce we get to this time, we'll declare a time to start a discussion or demo.

By the end of this session, you'll have had time to review your Hadoop learning, ask questions, and try things out on a small Hadoop cluster running in AWS. Our lab clusters are runring on Cloudera's Distribution of Hadoop (CDH) version 5.7.0.  

Your guides for today's session are:
* Michael Ernest, Senior Learning Architect, Cloudera

* Nicholas Preztak, Sales Engineer, Cloudera
